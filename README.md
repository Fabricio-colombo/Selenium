# Selenium Projects

This repository, named "Selenium," is dedicated to the implementation of test projects using Selenium. Currently, it features two automation projects.

## Project: Invoice Automation

The goal of the Invoice Automation project is to automate the process of issuing invoices. The script utilizes Selenium to automatically fill in the necessary fields in a web form, reading the information from an Excel spreadsheet. After filling in the details, the script issues the invoice and reloads the page to start a new cycle. To execute the script, ensure that dependencies are installed and configure the path to the Excel file and the correct web page in the code.

## Project: WhatsApp Warm-up Bot

The WhatsApp Warm-up project aims to simulate random conversations to "warm up" WhatsApp numbers before initiating a real message-sending process to leads. The bot uses Selenium to send random messages to numbers obtained from an Excel spreadsheet. The process is continuous, providing warming to the specified numbers. Before executing the script, install the dependencies and configure the path to the Excel file in the code.
